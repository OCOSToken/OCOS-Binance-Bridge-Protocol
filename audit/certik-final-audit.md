## 🛠️ Recommendations

CertiK recommends the following improvements:

- Replace hardcoded timeouts with configurable parameters via `onlyOwner`
- Use additional signature-based off-chain verification for extreme withdrawals
- Add `event Indexed` metadata for better cross-chain explorer integration

All recommendations were implemented by the OCOS development team prior to final deployment.
