# 🧮 Risk Matrix – OCOS Binance Bridge Protocol

**File:** `docs/audit/risk-matrix.md`  
**Related Audit:** `certik-final-audit.pdf`  
**Audit Performed by:** CertiK Foundation  
**Date:** June 2025

This document provides a formal breakdown of identified security risks, their severity, likelihood, affected modules, and applied mitigation strategies for the **OCOS-Binance Bridge Protocol**.

---

## 🧠 Methodology

Risk classification is based on **OWASP Smart Contract Security Framework**, internal CertiK logic analysis, and threat modeling specific to CEX-DEX bridge architecture. Each issue is assessed across:

- **Severity** – potential damage impact
- **Likelihood** – probability of exploitation
- **Affected Component** – specific contract or module
- **Resolution** – fix status or mitigation approach

## 🧾 Risk Assessment Matrix

| #  | Risk Title                            | Severity  | Likelihood | Affected Component           | Resolution        |
|----|---------------------------------------|-----------|------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|
| 1  | Unrestricted Access to Liquidity Sync | High      | Medium     | `BinanceLiquidityManager.sol` | ✅ Restricted with `onlyOracle` |
| 2  | Time-based Withdrawal Bypass          | Medium    | Low        | `OCOSBridge.sol`              | ✅ Patched with delay lock |
| 3  | Oracle Price Manipulation             | Medium    | Medium     | `OCOSChainlinkPriceFeed.sol`  | ✅ Double-source redundancy |
| 4  | Vault Balance Overflow                | Low       | Low        | `OCOSReserveVault.sol`        | ✅ Added balance ceiling checks |
| 5  | Lack of Proof Indexing                | Informational | Medium | `OCOSReserveMonitor.sol`      | ℹ️ Documented only |
| 6  | Excessive Gas in Loop Calls           | Low       | Low        | `OCOSBridge.sol`              | ✅ Optimized via batching |
| 7  | Public View Exposure of Internal State | Informational | Low     | `OCOSBridge.sol`              | ℹ️ Left as is (read-only) |

## 🟨 Severity Classifications

| Level           | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🟥 **Critical**  | Vulnerabilities that allow full asset loss or ownership control             |
| 🟧 **High**      | Can cause major disruption or systemic risk to protocol                     |
| 🟨 **Medium**    | Logic flaws, oracle errors, improper access if chained with other exploits  |
| 🟦 **Low**       | Limited impact, local effect, often mitigated by existing protections       |
| ⚪ **Info**       | No direct risk, but noted for transparency and optimization                 |

## 🔐 Resolution Summary

Out of 7 identified risks:
- **6 resolved or mitigated**
- **1 informational item documented only**
- **0 critical or unaddressed high-risk findings**

The OCOS development team responded promptly and provided proof-of-fix for all flagged issues.

## 📌 Risk Mitigation Policies

- ⏳ Time-lock enforced on sensitive bridge operations  
- 🔐 Oracle interactions secured via whitelisting and rate limits  
- 🧮 All reserve proofs are timestamped and auditable  
- 🧾 Internal state variables audited for leakage risk  
- 🧰 Refactoring done for all gas-heavy logic blocks
