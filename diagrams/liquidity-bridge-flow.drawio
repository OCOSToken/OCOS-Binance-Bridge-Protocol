## 📄 Description

This diagram illustrates the **liquidity flow architecture** between OCOS Token smart contracts and the Binance CEX integration. It visualizes the bridge, oracles, reserve vaults, price syncing, and transaction validation layers.

This visual is intended for developers, auditors, and stakeholders to understand how on-chain and off-chain systems interact during:

- Deposits to OCOS from Binance
- Withdrawals from OCOS to Binance
- Real-time reserve proofing
- Oracle-based price enforcement
- Multisig-controlled liquidity release
